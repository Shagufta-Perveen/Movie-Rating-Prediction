# Movie Rating Prediction with Python  

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **movie ratings** using machine learning models.  
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akash1vishwakarma/movie-rating-prediction-with-python), and the goal is to analyze different movie-related features to estimate ratings more accurately.  

Through this project, I explored **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression models, and evaluation metrics** to build a complete prediction pipeline.
